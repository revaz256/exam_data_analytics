Data Analytics project using Pandas and Matplotlib in Jupyter Notebook. 

In the file "Exams Data Analysis", I utilize a dataset of exam scores in math, reading, and writing, in an attempt to analyze different factors that may be the cause for differences in test scores between students.

In the file "Outlier Detection Techniques and Modeling", I utilize the exam score dataset to detect univariate and multivariate outliers
and visualize them using different types of graphs such as box plots, bar charts, and scatter plots.

Coded in Python.
